# K-Nearest-Neighbor-Classification-Project
A machine learning project that illustrates the use of the K-Nearest Neighbors algorithm from scratch. Here, multiple distance metrics were compared, decision boundaries were visualized, model performance was evaluated using confusion matrices and classification reports, and the best value of k for the highest accuracy was identified
